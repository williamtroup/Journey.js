# Journey.js - Change Log:

## Version 0.2.0:
- Minor documentation improvements.
- Added a new binding custom trigger called "onClose", which states an event that should be triggered when the dialog is closed on a specific DOM element.
- Fixed a fault that caused the CSS class "journey-js-element-focus" to remain on an element when the dialog is closed.
- A "title" or "description" must be set for the binding options for a DOM element to be accepted.
- Spacing is now applied for the first item in the dialog (to prevent overlaps with the close button).

## Version 0.1.0:
- Everything :)

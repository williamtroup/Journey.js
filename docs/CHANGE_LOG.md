# Journey.js - Change Log:

## Version 0.2.0:
- Fixed missing configuration documentation, with minor fixes and improvements elsewhere.
- Added a new binding custom trigger called "onClose", which states an event that should be triggered when the dialog is closed on a specific DOM element.
- Fixed a fault that caused the CSS class "journey-js-element-focus" to remain on an element when the dialog is closed.
- A "title" or "description" must be set for the binding options for a DOM element to be accepted.
- Spacing is now applied for the first item in the dialog (to prevent overlaps with the close button).
- Internal cleanups of the core JS code.
- Added new configuration option "showCloseButton" (defaults to true), which states if the close button is shown on the dialog.

# Contributing to Journey.js

Everyone is welcome to contribute to the project! However, I do ask that you observe the following rules:

When creating a Pull Request:

1.  State what the intension of the Pull Request is. For example, what are you fixing? what are you adding? etc.
2.  Stick to the full coding style standards used throughout the project.
3.  Make sure you have added adequate tests to cover the changes made.
